## Version 0.1.2.2
- Fixed version in `Cargo.toml` from `0.1.2.1` to `0.1.2` as Cargo doesn't support the previous format.

## Version 0.1.2.1
- Fixed a mistake in implementing the `setuptools_rust` & created the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Version 0.1.2
- Using `pip install rskeyring` will now compile the rust code to a native binary, allowing cross-platforming.
